# millerPrimeTest

Implement (in Python) a function that takes an integer as input and returns True or False as output, indicating whether or not the integer is prime. Use the Monte Carlo probabalistic algorithm discussed in section 7.2, so that it will finish in reasonable time given several hundred digit test numbers. We will use this piece of code later when we implement RSA encription.
Hint: Replace the Python command:
remainder = b ** e % n
with the equivalent but far faster:
remainder = pow(b,e,n)

Reminder: Do not go find code on the web that does this. This is a programming class, so implement your own solutions!
